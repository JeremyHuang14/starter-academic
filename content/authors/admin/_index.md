Hello! I'm Diancheng Huang, an undergraduate majoring in physics at Soochow University. I am currently investigating the thermoelectric properties of doped BaTiO3 near its ferroelectric transition in Prof. Bin Xu's computational condensed matter group. Previous to this, I have been in Prof. Yu Xin's experimental group to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of IrO2-SrTiO3.

My current interest is mainly in condensed matter physics, e.g. correlated electron systems, topological materials, two-dimensional materials, spectroscopy (SEM, TEM, ARPES, neutron scattering). Also, some other areas like quantum information and transimission, AMO (ultracold atoms, optical/phonon crystals) are very interesting to me.
